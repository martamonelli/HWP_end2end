# HWP_end2end
This code propagates the half-wave plate (HWP) non-idealities through map-making, foreground cleaning (HILC), and angular power spectra estimation, to return the value of the observed tensor-to-scalar ratio.
It was used to perform the analysis presented in <a href="url">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07999</a> and returns the same plots as those shown in the paper.

Dependencies (other than standard Python libraries): <code>healpy</code> and <code>camb</code>.

The input files avaliable are for an ideal HWP. Realistic input files can be provided upon request.
